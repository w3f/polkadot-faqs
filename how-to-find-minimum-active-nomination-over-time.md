Not sure if there is a site with that, but you can always look it up by querying chain state:

Go to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/chainstate

Enter the block hash you want to check what it was

Query and see the result in Plancks

You could write a JavaScript script ( https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/js ) to get this over time.

I'd have to look up the details, but essentially, there was no limit at first. About a year ago, a minimum 40 DOT nomination was initiated, then 80, then 120, then 160 in February. With some major staking mechanism changes, the minimum to nominate over the last few months has been 10 DOT, albeit with a dynamic rewards minimum.

Nomination pools (now live on Kusama) should reduce this dramatically, down to 1 DOT or so.
