This is up to governance to decide. Anyone can make a proposal to change the ideal number of validators ( https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-democracy#proposing-an-action ), you can do it right now - the relevant extrinsic is staking.setValidatorCount.

However, the last time this was proposed, it was rejected by DOT holders. See https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/29

> On the polkadot website is stated that it's planned to have 10 validators per parachain, the auction number 30 is few weeks away so the current 297 validators is not enough according to the website. Will there be an increase of the active validator number before the 30th parachain is onboarded?

Theoretically you could validate with a single validator per parachain (although that's a bad idea for a variety of reasons of security / reliability reasons). The plan is to have 10 validators per parachain but that does not mean it's a necessity.
