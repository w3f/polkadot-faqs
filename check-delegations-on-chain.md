You have to query democracy.votingOf now, which returns a JSON with both votes and delegations. For an example you can check out HHt1d2Sf7aERcm1FMG7scnJCZH4M6bazYSKc1j5zfZmcDzG, which I just set to delegate to me. Querying for votingOf includes the following:

```
Delegating: {
    balance: 200,000,000,000
    target: JFArxqV6rqPSwBok3zQDnj5jL6vwsZQDwYXXqb1cFygnYVt
    conviction: None
    delegations: {
      votes: 0
      capital: 0
    }
```
