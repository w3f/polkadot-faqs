It's impossible to know exactly in advance. Staking rewards per era are based on era points, which are essentially impossible to predict ahead of time. The rate of inflationand staking rewards are also variable based on the staking rate (i.e., what percentage of total issuance of all DOT is staked), which will obviously vary based on people's opinions of if they should stake or not.

The Polkadot-JS App Targets page provides estimates, but these are just that, estimates.

If you want to know how much you have received in the past, you can view your actual staking rewards using most block explorers (e.g. Subscan) and calculate it. Here are the rewards of a random example account (whatever the last one to receive a reward was): https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/13s9RrQSFbnp2TneY7nkdLmGc3ijBw12YQct8pc8km36Z9hg?tab=reward

Note that there is no such thing as "staking on Ledger". You can use Ledger to stake on-chain, but this does not change the fact that Ledger is just a tool to access the on-chain staking mechanism.
