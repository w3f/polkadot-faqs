if you ask them the addresses they used to make the account, you can make the multisig yourself and verify it's the same address
it would be essentially impossible for them to generate a single-sig with the same address

### Steps to do that:

1. Add addresses to Address Book - https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/addresses
2. Go to Accounts and click "+ Multisig"
3. Add the addresses and the threshold
4. Give it a name
5. Click "Create"

You will then have a new multisig in your Accounts tab (which you can't sign transactions with, but you can click the dots icon and get the address and verify it's what they say)
