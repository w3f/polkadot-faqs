## Why can't I see certain pages on Polkadot-JS, such as Extrinsics or Sign and Verify?

These pages require at least one account on Polkadot-JS. Go the Accounts page and add an account, and you should see these in the header bar.

Note that these pages may load if you navigate directly to them (e.g. https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics), but you won't be able to do anything there.
