Is there technically a difference between XCM and XCMP?

Yes. XCM is the cross-consensus message format; XCMP is a cross-chain messaging protocol. Think of sending a tax form to your government via the postal system - the form you send is the FORMAT of the message you are sending them, a very specific format; the mail system is the PROTOCOL of how it gets there.
