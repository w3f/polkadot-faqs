There is no text stored on-chain to describe what change the proposal is making. Proposals change either the parameters of the chain or the runtime code itself directly. See https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#referenda

Text-based descriptions are generally put on Polkassembly, e.g. https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/218, but the actual change is done automatically if it passed (see the "arguments" section for what the proposal is actually doing).

During the proposal, only the hash of the proposal is submitted; the actual change should be submitted later. See https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-democracy#submitting-a-preimage

(these links are obviously for Polkadot but the general idea is the same if you are using the democracy pallet no matter which chain you are using)
